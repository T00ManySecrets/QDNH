# QDNH
- Quansheng Dock Network Host

Allows a radio to be hosted on a network (even over the internet) which Quansheng Dock or QDockX can then connect to.  

This is a core .NET console application.

# QDockX
- A similar application to Quansheng Dock only aimed at portable devices designed specifically to operate with QDNH.

The Android APK for QDockX is available in the latest release section. You will NOT find this on the Play Store. Publishing and maintaining an App on the store is a nightmare. So it's distributed as an APK. In order to install it you have to enable installation of unknown apps on your device.
